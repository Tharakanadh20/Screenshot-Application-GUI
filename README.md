# Screenshot-Application-GUI
The "ScreenshotAppGUI" project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. The application allows users to take screenshots with a delay of 3 seconds after clicking the "Take a Screenshot" button. The captured screenshots are saved in a specified directory with unique filenames based on the current timestamp. The GUI features a modern and user-friendly design with themed buttons and labels for a visually appealing experience. Users can also exit the application by clicking the "Quit" button. The project serves as a basic example of creating a GUI application for a specific task using Python and Tkinter.
